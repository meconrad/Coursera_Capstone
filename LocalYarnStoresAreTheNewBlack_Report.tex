\title{Local Yarn Stores are the New Black}
\begin{document}

		\noindent This analysis was conducted in fulfillment of the IBM Data Science Certification Capstone Project requirement. \\
		
		\noindent In this study, the Foursquare API is used to determine which location in the Region of Waterloo is the most viable for a ``Local Yarn Store" (LYS). LYSs are emerging as a niche spot for young to middle-aged adults. \\
		
		\noindent Geographical data from Foursquare is used to determine the *best* location for a new LYS, should a prospective business-owner wish to know. This new location will likely be one that isn't too close to other LYSs, or any local big box stores that are likely to sell similar products for lower costs. Additionally, it would be ideal to place the new location near high traffic, high population density parts of the Region.\\
		
		\noindent Five locations are suggested based on the data analysis: 1 in Waterloo, 2 in Kitchener, and 2 in Cambridge. Of the 5, the Kitchener locations are suggested to be the most viable for success based on the chosen criteria.\\

	\chapter{Introduction}
		\section{What \textit{is} a `Local Yarn Store',  Anyway?}
	``Local Yarn Stores" (LYS) seem to be a niche establishment to an unknowing individual, used only by grannies and crazy cat ladies. But what many people don't know is that within the knitting and crochet fibre community, MANY young folx are ditching the big box stores like "Michael's" for unique and inspiring LYSs. It is here that you can find yarn hand-dyed by your super talented neighbour, yarn hand-spun from fleece, sourced from the next town over, and sometimes even hand-brewed specialty coffee (Hello, Knitting Loft, Toronto!)! LYSs are seriously underestimated treasure troves.
	
	\section{Business Problem Outline}
	
	Here's the big idea: we want to open up a \textit{new} LYS to serve the yarn-obsessed community.\\
	
	\noindent Currently in KW, there are only 3 LYS \textit{that I know of} within a 20 - 30 minute drive radius. We can use geographical data from Foursquare to determine any other LYS, as well as high traffic shopping locations. In addition to the Foursquare API, we can utilize publically available population data from Stats Canada to determine the Region of Waterloo municipal population density, and publically available municipal boundary data from the Region of Waterloo for visual mapping purposes. The LYS/ Shopping Center data, population data, and municipal boundary data will allow us to determine the most ideal location for a new LYS. \\
	
	\noindent For the purposes of this project, we will assume we don't already know the quantity and locations of \textit{any} LYS within the Region of Waterloo.\\
	
	\noindent The data utilized in this analysis will be provided in Chapter 2, the data analysis methodology will be described in Chapter 3, and a Discussion and Conclusions will be provided in Chapter 4.
	
	
	\section{Interest}
	Prospective LYS owners would be interested in these results. If looking into a different region, along with obtaining that Region's specific GeoJSON and population data, one could simply alter the coordinate input. This code could also be useful for someone looking to open any other type of store; one would simply have to alter the Foursquare search queries. This code is really quite versatile and could easily be manipulated to serve the user's needs.

	\chapter{Data}
	\section{Foursquare API: LYS, Michael's,  and Shopping Center Locations}
	The Foursquare API was used to collect locations and information about LYS, Michael's stores, and shopping centers in the Region of Waterloo. \\
	
	\noindent When querying for LYS, the search query ``yarn'' was used with a radius of 30.0 km and a threshold limit of 30 results. The JSON results were transformed into a pandas dataframe with from \texttt{pandas.io.json.json\_normalize}. In terms of cleaning the results, only location columns were kept (along with the venue name and category), the venue category was changed to only state the category name, and only the last term was kept when the column name contained 2 or more terms. Based on prior knowledge of the region, venue results that either were returned by mistake or were previously closed were dropped. Any missing venue entries  (i.e Shall We Knit?) were added manually. The final dataframe is given in Figure \ref{fig:dflys} for example.

	\end{figure}
	
	When querying for Michael's Arts and Crafts stores, the search query ``Michaels'' was used with a radius of 30.0 km and a threshold limit of 30 results. The cleaning methods mentioned above were used. Any entries that were not in the category``Arts and Crafts" were dropped.\\

	\noindent When querying for Shopping Malls, the search query ``shopping mall'' was used with a radius of 50.0 km and a threshold limit of 50 results. The threshold and radius were increased to allow for clustered shopping areas to be evident. The same cleaning methods were used. Bus lines and duplicate venues were dropped; i.e., stores within malls that contained the mall name.

	
	\section{Stats Canada 2016 Census Population Data}
	Population data for the KW region can be obtained from StatsCanada:\\
	
	\noindent \url{https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page\_Hierarchy-Hierarchie.cfm?Lang=E\&Tab=1\&Geo1=CMACA\&Code1=541\&Geo2=PR\&Code2=35\&SearchText=Kitchener\%20-\%20Cambridge\%20-\%20Waterloo\&SearchType=Begins\&SearchPR=01\&B1=Population\&TABID=1\&type=0}\\
	
	\noindent From this URL, I obtained 2016 census data for the following municipalities:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Kitchener
		\item Cambridge
		\item Waterloo
		\item North Dumfries
		\item Wilmot
		\item Woolwich
		\item Wellesley
	\end{itemize}

	Once the .CSV files were read in with pandas, they were cleaned in such a way as to reduce confusion and to ensure compatibility across Data. An example of one of these dataframes can be found in Table \ref{Waterloo_df}. To get to this cleaned stage, multiple columns were dropped (columns = [`Note', `Flag\_Total', `Flag\_Male', `Flag\_Female', `Flag\_Total.1', `Flag\_Male.1', `Flag\_Female.1'] - these are simply notes provided within the table), and only rows pertaining to 'Population and dwellings' and `Age characteristics' were kept. In hindsight, `Age characteristics' could have been dropped as well, although it was thought to potentially be useful at the time.

	The population density of each municipality was extracted from their respective dataframes using \texttt{pd.iloc()}. The extracted values can be found in Table \ref{MunicipalityPopulationDensity}. These population densities were placed in a new dataframe, along with the Municipality names and their respective coordinates, in order to be easily mapped with \textit{Folium}; this Python package allows the population density to be visually presented as a layer on a map.

	\chapter{Analysis}
	Once the data from Foursquare, Stats Canada, and the Region of Waterloo have been cleaned and prepared, they can be used to generate interactive maps of the Region with the Python package \textit{Folium}. These maps will act as the foundation for our conclusions. \\
	
	\noindent Before mapping with \textit{Folium}, the population densities acquired from Stats Canada were plotted in a bar-graph with \textit{Matplotlib} (see Figure \ref{fig:bargraph}). From this, it is evident that the 3 municipalities with the highest population density are: Kitchener, Waterloo, and Cambridge. This is no surprise.\\

	\end{figure}

	 \noindent Municipal boundaries obtained from the Region of Waterloo can be found mapped in Figure \ref{fig:screen-shot-2019-10-15-at-2}; municipal center coordinates (red), LYS locations (blue), and Michael's locations (green) are mapped in Figure \ref{fig:foliumboundarywithdots}. High traffic shopping centers (like malls; yellow) are added in Figure \ref{fig:foliumshopping}. The ideal location will be in high density locations (dark blue), near highways, near the yellow markers (shopping centers), and away from green and blue markers (LYS and Michael's).

	\chapter{Results \& Discussion}
	
	Local Yarn Stores (LYS) are unique little havens for both young and elderly knitters and crocheters. We are interested in knowing where the most ideal location would be for a new LYS, in terms of both success and accessibility. \\
	
	\noindent By inspection of the \textit{Folium} maps, let's choose 5 locations that meet the following criteria: 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Near high population density regions
		\item Far enough away from other yarn stores that competition isn't a concern
		\item Near highways for easy access
		\item Perhaps near high traffic shopping centers
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\noindent The geographical coordinates of the 5 potential locations are provided in Table \ref{guesstimatecoords_df} and are mapped in Figures \ref{fig:final1} and \ref{fig:final2}. The locations that are near a Michaels store would still be ideal; Michael's isn't exactly the same as a LYS, thus enabling each type of store to have their own niche markets. In fact, customers would likely view this location as a ``two birds, one stone" scenario. Zoomed-in \textit{Folium} maps of each individual location are given in Figures \ref{fig:WaterlooLocation}, \ref{fig:kitchenerLocations}, and \ref{fig:cambridgeLocations}; example building locations have been selected.\\

\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
\noindent Considering the population density, the central nature within the region, and the nearness to local highways, the potential Local Yarn Store (LYS) locations in KITCHENER would likely be the most successful.\\

\noindent In the future, one could further consider the population data obtained from the Stats Canada 2016 Census. This data supplies the population within specific age groups and genders. While, in my opinion as a 27-year-old woman, the yarn obsession is real for humans of all ages, LYS do tend to be more expensive than, for example, Michael's. One skein of hand-dyed yarn runs at approximately \$32 CAD while one skein from Lion Brand Yarn, sold at Michael's, runs at approximately \$6 -- \$10 CAD. Bearing this in mind, established adults might be more keen on spending nearly triple the amount. Prioritizing municipalities where the density of adults aged 30+ is maximized may help boost the success of the new LYS. \\
